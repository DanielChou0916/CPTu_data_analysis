# Cone Penetration Test (CPT) Data Analysis

This repository contains **data analysis and machine learning applications for Cone Penetration Test (CPTu)**.  
It serves as a collection of **learning notes** from the course **Foundation Systems**, offered by **Dr. Paul Mayne**.  
Relevant literature used for calculations is provided in the reference section below.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sub-folders:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Geoparameters Characterization**
   - Demonstrates an example of evaluating **strength parameters** from **CPTu data**.  
   - Includes calculations for soil **friction angle**, **cohesion**, and other geotechnical properties.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning for Soil Behavior Classification**
   - Uses a **cleaned CPTu dataset** to train a **machine learning model** for **soil behavior type (SBT) classification**.  
   - Applies ML techniques to predict soil types based on CPTu measurements.

---

## üìñ Learning Objectives
- Understand **geotechnical parameters** derived from CPTu tests.
- Apply **machine learning techniques** for classifying soil behavior.
- Explore **real-world CPTu data processing** and interpretation.
